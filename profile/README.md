# The Zune is back - now led by the people who use it.
The Zune, introduced by Microsoft in 2006, was a bold attempt to compete in the digital media player and music streaming market dominated by Apple's iPod and iTunes. The Zune featured a sleek design, wireless sharing capabilities, and a subscription-based music service. However, despite its innovations, it struggled to gain significant market share, largely overshadowed by the iPod's popularity. Microsoft eventually discontinued the Zune hardware in 2011, marking the end of the Zune era.
But guess what? **It's back!**

The Zune Go project emulates the Zune's main functions[^1] - avaliable for any MakeCode Arcade device.

Wait, did we just hear you ask for an emulator? Check! It's at [arcade.makecode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com/).

[^1]: No, there isn't a music streaming service. Or any wireless sharing capabillities. Everything is offline.
