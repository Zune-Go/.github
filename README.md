# Zune GO
**The legacy of Microsoft Zune continues - _in the heart of our community_.**

The Zune, introduced by Microsoft in 2006, was a bold attempt to compete in the digital media player and music streaming market dominated by Apple's iPod and iTunes. The Zune featured a sleek design, wireless sharing capabilities, and a subscription-based music service. However, despite its innovations, it struggled to gain significant market share, largely overshadowed by the iPod's popularity. Microsoft eventually discontinued the Zune hardware in 2011, marking the end of the Zune era. But, over a decade later, **it's back!!!* Now community-run, it emulates a Zune media player - avaliable on any MakeCode Arcade device.
